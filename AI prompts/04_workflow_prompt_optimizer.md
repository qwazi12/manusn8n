## Optimization Strategy

### Prompt Enhancement
Transform basic requests into comprehensive specifications:

**Original**: "Create a workflow for social media posting"
**Optimized**: "Build a comprehensive social media automation workflow that:
- Triggers on schedule (daily at 9 AM)
- Pulls content from Google Sheets content calendar
- Uses AI to optimize post text for each platform
- Posts to Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook simultaneously
- Tracks engagement metrics in Google Sheets
- Sends performance summary via Slack
- Includes error handling for API failures
- Implements rate limiting for platform compliance"

### Technical Specification
Add production-ready requirements:
- **Error Handling**: Retry logic, fallback options, error notifications
- **Rate Limiting**: Wait nodes, batch processing, API compliance
- **Data Validation**: Input checking, format verification, required fields
- **Monitoring**: Success tracking, performance metrics, failure alerts
- **Security**: Credential management, data protection, access controls

### Pattern Application
Apply proven patterns from production workflows:
- **HTTP Request patterns**: Authentication, headers, error handling
- **Google Sheets integration**: Data mapping, batch operations, formatting
- **AI Agent patterns**: System messages, tool integration, memory management
- **Scheduling patterns**: Cron expressions, timezone handling, failure recovery

## **Full Prompt Content**

You are given a conversation between a user and the NodePilot AI assistant.
You are to determine the information that might be useful to remember for future n8n workflow generation conversations.

<positive_criteria>
These should include:
- High-level preferences about how the user likes n8n workflows to be structured (MUST be specific and actionable)
- General patterns or approaches the user prefers for n8n workflow design (MUST include clear guidance)
- Specific technical preferences related to n8n (e.g., preferred node types, error handling strategies, credential usage)
- Common pain points or frustrations to avoid in n8n workflow generation (MUST be specific enough to act on)
- n8n workflow preferences or requirements (MUST include concrete steps or rules for workflow logic)
- Any recurring themes in their n8n workflow requests (MUST be specific enough to guide future responses)
- Anything the user explicitly asks to remember regarding n8n workflows
- Any strong opinions expressed by the user about n8n or automation (MUST be specific enough to act on)
</positive_criteria>

<negative_criteria>
Do NOT include:
- One-time n8n workflow-specific details that don't generalize
- Implementation specifics of a single n8n workflow that won't be reused
- Temporary context that won't be relevant later for n8n workflow generation
- Context that comes purely from the assistant chat, not the user chat.
- Information that ONLY applies to the specific n8n nodes, expressions, or workflow snippets discussed in the current conversation and is not broadly applicable.
- Vague or obvious preferences that aren't actionable regarding n8n workflows
- General statements about good automation practices that any user would want
- Basic n8n principles such as modularity, reusability, or clear naming conventions.
</negative_criteria>

<formatting_instructions>
Return your response in the following JSON format:
{
	"explanation": "Explain here, for every negative example, why the memory below does *not* violate any of the negative criteria. Be specific about which negative criteria it avoids.",
	"memory": "preference-name: The general preference or approach to remember. DO NOT include specific details from the current conversation. Keep it short, to max 3 sentences. Do not use examples that refer to the conversation."
}
</formatting_instructions>

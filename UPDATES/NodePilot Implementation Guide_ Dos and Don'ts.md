# NodePilot Implementation Guide: Dos and Don'ts

## ‚úÖ WHAT TO DO

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
- **Replace the 4 enhanced prompts** in your system immediately
- **Test with complex workflow requests** to measure accuracy improvements
- **Keep the enhanced prompts as system instructions** in your AI calls
- **Use environment variables** for all API keys and sensitive data
- **Implement the enhanced validation system** for quality checking
- **Track accuracy metrics** before and after implementation

### System Architecture
- **Store enhanced prompts as system prompts** in your backend
- **Let AI generate workflows dynamically** based on user requests
- **Use the enhanced intent classification** for better routing
- **Implement proper error handling** as described in the enhanced prompts
- **Add comprehensive logging** for debugging and monitoring
- **Use caching** for similar workflow requests to save costs

### Code Implementation
- **Use the exact enhanced prompt text** as system instructions
- **Implement multi-stage validation** as outlined in the enhanced validator
- **Add timeout configurations** (30 seconds for API calls, 60 for file operations)
- **Include retry logic** with exponential backoff
- **Validate all generated JSON** against n8n schema
- **Add proper error messages** for users when validation fails

### Testing and Quality
- **Test with simple, intermediate, and complex workflows**
- **Measure accuracy improvements** against your current system
- **Validate generated workflows** in actual n8n instances
- **Monitor generation speed** and resource usage
- **Collect user feedback** on workflow quality
- **Track success rates** for different workflow types

## ‚ùå WHAT NOT TO DO

### Never Hardcode These
- **API keys or credentials** - Always use environment variables
- **Specific workflow JSON templates** - Let AI generate dynamically
- **User-specific data** - Keep everything dynamic and user-agnostic
- **Hardcoded URLs or endpoints** - Make them configurable
- **Fixed node configurations** - Let AI determine optimal settings
- **Static workflow patterns** - AI should adapt to user needs

### Avoid These Mistakes
- **Don't modify the enhanced prompts** without testing impact on accuracy
- **Don't skip the validation system** - It's critical for production quality
- **Don't ignore error handling** - Implement comprehensive error management
- **Don't hardcode n8n node parameters** - Let AI configure them properly
- **Don't use outdated n8n node information** - The enhanced prompts have current data
- **Don't skip testing** - Always validate generated workflows work in n8n

### System Architecture Mistakes
- **Don't store workflows as static templates** - Generate them dynamically
- **Don't bypass intent classification** - It's crucial for accuracy
- **Don't skip prompt optimization** - Use the enhanced optimizer for complex requests
- **Don't ignore performance considerations** - Implement caching and optimization
- **Don't forget monitoring** - Track system performance and accuracy
- **Don't mix business logic with prompts** - Keep them separate and configurable

### Implementation Pitfalls
- **Don't rush implementation** - Test each enhanced prompt individually
- **Don't ignore the 16-week roadmap** - It provides systematic improvement
- **Don't skip documentation** - Document your implementation decisions
- **Don't forget backup plans** - Keep your old prompts until new ones are proven
- **Don't ignore user feedback** - Monitor and respond to accuracy issues
- **Don't optimize prematurely** - Get basic accuracy working first

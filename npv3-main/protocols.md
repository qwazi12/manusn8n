# NodePilot ‚Äî Automated Code Review & GitHub Backup Protocol

This document defines the mandatory review process that AI Coding Assistants (Claude, Cursor, GPT) and developers must follow before committing code to GitHub for the NodePilot SaaS project.

> **Golden Rule:** No code shall be committed to GitHub without fully passing this checklist.

## üîÑ GitHub Backup Protocol

### Daily Backup Process

1. **Pre-Backup Checks**
   ```bash
   # Check for uncommitted changes
   git status
   
   # Run tests
   npm test
   
   # Check for linting errors
   npm run lint
   ```

2. **Commit Process**
   ```bash
   # Stage all changes
   git add .
   
   # Create commit with standardized message
   git commit -m "feat: [Area] - Clear description"
   
   # Push to main branch
   git push origin main
   ```

### Branch Management

| Branch Type | Format | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Feature | `feature/[feature-name]` | New features |
| Bug Fix | `fix/[bug-name]` | Bug fixes |
| Hotfix | `hotfix/[issue-name]` | Urgent fixes |
| Documentation | `docs/[topic]` | Documentation updates |
| Release | `release/[version]` | Version releases |

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create PR**
   - From feature/fix branch
   - Include detailed description
   - Link related issues
   - Add screenshots if UI changes

2. **Review Requirements**
   - At least 2 approvals
   - All checks pass
   - No merge conflicts
   - Documentation updated

3. **Merge Process**
   - Squash and merge
   - Delete source branch
   - Update related issues
   - Update changelog

## ü§ñ Automated Workflows

### CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: NodePilot CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run lint

  build:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
```

### Automated Checks

- ESLint on every commit
- TypeScript compilation
- Test coverage
- Build verification
- Dependency updates
- Security scanning

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Data Loss Prevention

1. **Regular Backups**
   - Daily automated backups
   - Weekly manual verification
   - Monthly full system backup

2. **Recovery Process**
   ```bash
   # Verify backup integrity
   git fsck
   
   # Restore from backup
   git checkout [commit-hash]
   
   # Force push if necessary
   git push -f origin main
   ```

### Security Incidents

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Revoke compromised credentials
   - Notify team members
   - Lock down repository
   - Begin investigation

2. **Post-Incident**
   - Document incident
   - Update security protocols
   - Review access controls
   - Implement additional safeguards

## üìù Protocol Updates

This protocol should be reviewed and updated:
- Monthly for minor updates
- Quarterly for major revisions
- After any security incident
- When new tools are adopted

## n8n Workflow Architecture

### Fundamental Structure

n8n workflows follow a specific JSON schema that defines the complete automation process. Understanding this structure is crucial for generating effective workflows that integrate seamlessly with the n8n platform.

**Core Workflow Components:**

The workflow JSON contains several essential sections that work together to create a functional automation. The root level includes metadata such as the workflow name, description, and tags that help with organization and discovery. The nodes array contains all the individual processing units that perform specific tasks, while the connections object defines how data flows between these nodes.

**Node Architecture:**

Each node in an n8n workflow represents a discrete unit of functionality with a standardized structure. Every node requires a unique identifier (typically a UUID), a human-readable name for identification, a type that determines its functionality, and a typeVersion that specifies the schema version. The position array controls visual placement on the canvas, while the parameters object contains all configuration specific to that node type.

**Connection Patterns:**

Connections in n8n define the data flow between nodes using a structured mapping system. The connections object uses node names as keys, with each containing arrays that specify which nodes receive the output. This allows for complex branching, merging, and conditional routing of data through the workflow.

### Data Flow Principles

**Item-Based Processing:** n8n processes data as arrays of items, where each item contains a json object with the actual data and an optional binary object for file attachments. This structure enables parallel processing and efficient handling of bulk operations.

**Expression System:** The expression language allows dynamic data manipulation using the `={{ }}` syntax. This enables workflows to access previous node outputs, perform calculations, format data, and make conditional decisions based on runtime values.

**Memory Management:** For AI-powered workflows, proper memory management is crucial. This includes session-based memory for chat applications, long-term storage for persistent information, and efficient cleanup to prevent memory leaks in long-running workflows.

### Workflow Types and Patterns

**Trigger-Based Workflows:** These begin with trigger nodes that respond to external events such as webhooks, scheduled times, email arrivals, or chat messages. The trigger determines when the workflow executes and provides initial data for processing.

**Processing Workflows:** Focus on data transformation, analysis, and manipulation. These typically involve multiple processing nodes that filter, aggregate, transform, or enrich data before producing final outputs.

**Integration Workflows:** Connect multiple external services and systems, handling authentication, data format conversion, and error recovery. These workflows often implement complex business logic that spans multiple platforms.

**AI-Powered Workflows:** Incorporate language models, embeddings, vector databases, and intelligent agents to provide cognitive capabilities. These workflows can understand natural language, make decisions, and interact with users in sophisticated ways.

## Expression Language Mastery

### Core Expression Patterns

**Data Access:**
- `{{ $json.fieldName }}` - Access current item field
- `{{ $node["NodeName"].json.field }}` - Access specific node output
- `{{ $items()[0].json.field }}` - Access first item in array
- `{{ $input.all() }}` - Access all input items

**Data Transformation:**
- `{{ $json.name.toUpperCase() }}` - String manipulation
- `{{ $json.price * 1.1 }}` - Mathematical operations
- `{{ $json.date.toDateTime() }}` - Date operations
- `{{ Object.keys($json) }}` - Object manipulation

**Conditional Logic:**
- `{{ $json.status === 'active' ? 'enabled' : 'disabled' }}` - Ternary operator
- `{{ $json.items.length > 0 }}` - Boolean expressions
- `{{ $json.value || 'default' }}` - Null coalescing

**Advanced Patterns:**
- `{{ $json.items.map(item => item.name) }}` - Array mapping
- `{{ $json.items.filter(item => item.active) }}` - Array filtering
- `{{ $json.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.value, 0) }}` - Array reduction

### Memory and Session Management

**Session Access:**
- `{{ $('Chat Trigger').item.json.sessionId }}` - Get session ID
- `{{ $memory.getChatMessages() }}` - Access chat history
- `{{ $vars.sessionData }}` - Access workflow variables

**Dynamic Configuration:**
- `{{ $json.config.apiUrl }}` - Dynamic API endpoints
- `{{ $credentials.apiKey }}` - Secure credential access
- `{{ $env.NODE_ENV }}` - Environment variables

## Performance Optimization Guidelines

### Efficient Data Processing

**Batch Processing Strategy:**
- Use Split in Batches node for large datasets
- Implement appropriate batch sizes (typically 10-100 items)
- Add Wait nodes between batches to respect rate limits
- Monitor memory usage for large data operations

**Caching Implementation:**
```json
{
  "id": "cache-check",
  "name": "Check Cache",
  "type": "n8n-nodes-base.code",
  "parameters": {
    "jsCode": "// Simple in-memory cache implementation\nconst cache = $vars.cache || {};\nconst cacheKey = $json.cacheKey;\nconst cacheExpiry = 3600000; // 1 hour\n\nif (cache[cacheKey] && (Date.now() - cache[cacheKey].timestamp) < cacheExpiry) {\n  return [{\n    json: {\n      ...cache[cacheKey].data,\n      fromCache: true\n    }\n  }];\n}\n\n// Cache miss - continue to API call\nreturn items;"
  }
}
```

### Memory Management for AI Workflows

**Conversation Memory Optimization:**
- Set appropriate context window lengths (10-20 messages for most use cases)
- Implement memory cleanup for long-running sessions
- Use summarization for old conversations
- Store important information in external systems

**Vector Store Optimization:**
- Use appropriate chunk sizes for document processing
- Implement metadata filtering for efficient retrieval
- Regular index maintenance and cleanup
- Monitor vector store usage and costs

### Rate Limiting and API Management

**Smart Rate Limiting:**
```json
{
  "id": "rate-limiter",
  "name": "Rate Limit Control",
  "type": "n8n-nodes-base.wait",
  "parameters": {
    "amount": "={{ Math.ceil($itemIndex / 10) }}",
    "unit": "seconds"
  }
}
```

**API Usage Monitoring:**
```json
{
  "id": "usage-tracker",
  "name": "Track API Usage",
  "type": "n8n-nodes-base.code",
  "parameters": {
    "jsCode": "// Track API usage and costs\nconst usage = $vars.apiUsage || { calls: 0, tokens: 0, cost: 0 };\nusage.calls += 1;\nusage.tokens += $json.usage?.total_tokens || 0;\nusage.cost += ($json.usage?.total_tokens || 0) * 0.00002; // Example pricing\n\n$vars.apiUsage = usage;\n\nreturn [{\n  json: {\n    ...item.json,\n    currentUsage: usage\n  }\n}];"
  }
}
```

---

## Security Best Practices

### Credential Management

**Secure API Key Handling:**
- Always use n8n's credential system
- Never hardcode API keys in workflow JSON
- Implement key rotation procedures
- Monitor credential usage and access

**Input Validation:**
```json
{
  "id": "input-validator",
  "name": "Validate Input",
  "type": "n8n-nodes-base.code",
  "parameters": {
    "jsCode": "// Comprehensive input validation\nfunction validateInput(data) {\n  const sanitized = {};\n  \n  // Remove potentially dangerous characters\n  for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(data)) {\n    if (typeof value === 'string') {\n      sanitized[key] = value\n        .replace(/<script[^>]*>.*?<\\/script>/gi, '')\n        .replace(/javascript:/gi, '')\n        .trim();\n    } else {\n      sanitized[key] = value;\n    }\n  }\n  \n  return sanitized;\n}\n\nreturn items.map(item => ({\n  json: validateInput(item.json)\n}));"
  }
}
```

### Data Protection

**Sensitive Data Handling:**
- Implement data masking for logs
- Use encryption for sensitive data storage
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular security audits and updates

**Privacy Compliance:**
```json
{
  "id": "privacy-filter",
  "name": "Privacy Compliance",
  "type": "n8n-nodes-base.code",
  "parameters": {
    "jsCode": "// Remove or mask PII data\nfunction maskPII(data) {\n  const masked = { ...data };\n  \n  // Mask email addresses\n  if (masked.email) {\n    const [local, domain] = masked.email.split('@');\n    masked.email = local.substring(0, 2) + '***@' + domain;\n  }\n  \n  // Mask phone numbers\n  if (masked.phone) {\n    masked.phone = masked.phone.replace(/.(?=.{4})/g, '*');\n  }\n  \n  return masked;\n}\n\nreturn items.map(item => ({\n  json: maskPII(item.json)\n}));"
  }
}
```

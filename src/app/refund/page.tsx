          <p className="mt-4">
            Thank you for choosing NodePilot. This policy outlines our no refunds approach for our credit-based n8n workflow generation service.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">No Refunds Policy</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>All Sales Final:</strong> All credit purchases on NodePilot are final and non-refundable. Once you purchase credits, they cannot be refunded under any circumstances.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            <strong>Credit-Based System:</strong> NodePilot operates on a credit system where you purchase credits to generate n8n workflows. Each successful workflow generation consumes credits from your account balance.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Why No Refunds</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>Instant Digital Delivery:</strong> Our service provides immediate value through AI-generated n8n workflows. Once a workflow is generated and delivered, the service has been provided.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            <strong>Resource Consumption:</strong> Each workflow generation consumes computational resources and AI processing power, making it impossible to "return" the service provided.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            <strong>Fair Usage:</strong> This policy ensures fair usage and prevents abuse of our AI-powered service.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">What You Get</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>Generated Workflows:</strong> You receive complete n8n workflow JSON files ready for import into your n8n instance.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            <strong>Detailed Explanations:</strong> Each workflow comes with comprehensive explanations of how it works.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            <strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> We strive to provide high-quality workflows that meet your described requirements.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Account Management</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>Credit Balance:</strong> You can view your current credit balance and usage history in your account dashboard.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            <strong>Credit Expiration:</strong> Credits do not expire unless your account remains inactive for more than 12 months.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            <strong>Account Termination:</strong> If you terminate your account, any remaining credits are forfeited and cannot be refunded.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Exceptions</h2>

          <p>
            We reserve the right to deny service and may consider account credit adjustments only in the following exceptional circumstances:
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            <strong>Technical Errors:</strong> If our system experiences a technical error that prevents workflow generation but still consumes credits, we may restore the consumed credits.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            <strong>Service Fraud:</strong> If we detect fraudulent activity on our platform that affects your account, we may investigate and potentially adjust credits.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            <strong>Terms Violations:</strong> Accounts that violate our Terms of Service forfeit all credits and are not eligible for any consideration.
          </p>
